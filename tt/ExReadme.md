# Timetable-React-DB

- Timetable website for bus transport in Koper

## Using React, Bootstrap, and PhpMyAdmin

# How to run
- Run `app.js`
- Run `React.app`


# After next
- Make the Line2A json files as they are missing
- Check the rest of the timetables, and insert 'x' into missing times places
- Put the Urniki or at least the app.js on github.

# Future (ce bos cas)
- Make an option that displays all of the times, so that the user can see all of the times if needed.


# Ideas for next project
## Terminal like project

- Entry and exit station text input fields that print the table of arrivals/departures.
- Very simplistic and easy to use.
- No picking lines and into/out of center.

## Timetable 2.0
- On entering/choosing your entry/exit station show all available line connections and the timetables.


# Knows errors :no_entry:
- Timetable for Linija1-Kampel has an error, the joining in the process of cleaning the string joined both mercator lines into one, so its corrupted.
- Big problems for timetable of Line11
- Timetable for Linija2 also has errors, as i left out all of the empty times. Needs to be reworked.
- Timetable for all lines need to be redone or adjusted.
- The goBack function and the button where it is called sometimes needs a double click to work.
- The navbar button is not aligned with the arrow icon inside of it.
